# Chiron
Chiron is a lightweight Linux distribution for x86_64 devices. It's built for system rescue, diagnostics, and stress testing. It has a terminal and a GUI (X11 / Openbox).

<br/>

Chiron can be booted from removable media such as USB storage devices and CDs, just write the ISO image to your selected media. Using tools like `ventoy` can be useful, as they let you boot multiple ISOs from the same USB storage device.
